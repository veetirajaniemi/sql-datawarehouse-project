DDL: Creating gold views
===============================================

Script purpose:
	This script creates views for the gold layer in the data warehouse.
	The gold layer includes the final dimensions and fact tables (Star Schema).

	Each view performs transformations combining data from the silver layer
	to produce a clean, business-ready dataset.
